@article{Rademaker2016,
	Abstract = {We study the consequences of an electron--phonon (e--ph) interaction that is strongly peaked in the forward scattering () direction in a two-dimensional superconductor using Migdal--{Eliashberg} theory. We find that strong forward scattering results in an enhanced Tc that is linearly proportional to the strength of the dimensionless e--ph coupling constant in the weak coupling limit. This interaction also produces distinct replica bands in the single-particle spectral function, similar to those observed in recent angle-resolved photoemission experiments on FeSe monolayers on SrTiO3 and BaTiO3 substrates. By comparing our model to photoemission experiments, we infer an e--ph coupling strength that can provide a significant portion of the observed high Tc in these systems.},

abstract={The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in iron-based compounds has attracted much attention. How to further increase the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) and how to understand the superconductivity mechanism are two prominent issues facing the current study of iron-based superconductors. The latest report of high-Tc superconductivity in a single-layer {FeSe} is therefore both surprising and significant. Here we present investigations of the electronic structure and superconducting gap of the single-layer {FeSe} superconductor. Its {Fermi} surface is distinct from other iron-based superconductors, consisting only of electron-like pockets near the zone corner without indication of any {Fermi} surface around the zone centre. Nearly isotropic superconducting gap is observed in this strictly two-dimensional system. The temperature dependence of the superconducting gap gives a transition temperature Tc{\textasciitilde} 55 K. These results have established a clear case that such a simple electronic structure is compatible with high-Tc superconductivity in iron-based superconductors.},

abstract={At temperatures above the superconducting transition temperature, the pairfield susceptibility provides information on the nature of the pairfield fluctuations. Here, we study the d-wave pairfield susceptibility of a 2D {Hubbard} model for a doping which has a pseudogap (PG) and for a doping which does not. In both cases, there will be a region of Kosterlitz--Thouless fluctuations as the transition at TKT is approached. Above this region, we find evidence for pairfield-order parameter-phase fluctuations for dopings with a PG and BCS Cooper pair fluctuations for dopings without a PG.},

abstract={In the traditional Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer theory of superconductivity, the amplitude for the propagation of a pair of electrons with momentum k and âˆ’k has a log singularity as the temperature decreases. This so-called Cooper instability arises from the presence of an electron Fermi sea. It means that an attractive interaction, no matter how weak, will eventually lead to a pairing instability. However, in the pseudogap regime of the cuprate superconductors, where parts of the Fermi surface are destroyed, this log singularity is suppressed, raising the question of how pairing occurs in the absence of a Fermi sea. Here we report {Hubbard} model numerical results and the analysis of angular-resolved photoemission experiments on a cuprate superconductor. In contrast to the traditional theory, we find that in the pseudogap regime the pairing instability arises from an increase in the strength of the spin--fluctuation pairing interaction as the temperature decreases rather than the Cooper log instability.},

abstract = {We present a submatrix update algorithm for the continuous-time auxiliary field method that allows the simulation of large lattice and impurity problems. The algorithm takes optimal advantage of modern CPU architectures by consistently using matrix instead of vector operations, resulting in a speedup of a factor of â‰ˆ8 and thereby allowing access to larger systems and lower temperature. We illustrate the power of our algorithm at the example of a cluster dynamical mean field simulation of the N{\'{e}}el transition in the three-dimensional {Hubbard} model, where we show momentum dependent self-energies for clusters with up to 100 sites.},
